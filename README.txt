The interactive python notebook contains the path planning algorithms.

I have written the entire code by myself.

Procedure for using the script to solve for the shortest path in a maze:
1) Upload a 100 x 100 picture of a maze as "Task_1_Low" in the same folder 
2) Ensure that the obstacles are in white and the open areas in black
3) Ensure that the Source is green [113, 204, 45] and Destination is red [60, 76, 231]
4) Run the python script
5) The program will create videos in the same folder
6) Each video shows an animation of the steps the algortihm took to reach the solution
7) The first 6 videos show the algorithm implemented when diagonal movements are not allowed
8) The next 6 videos show the algorithm implemented when diagonal movements are allowed
9) Each of the 6 videos has a different heuristic as mentioned in the title
